## Crustwind

Utility-first Styling framework in Rust.

Crustwind shares some similarities with both [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). 
It's strongly typed, and has an explicit approach to handling styling conflicts: any form of utility class merging is prohibited.

Crustwind provides support for WebComponent in [htmx](https://htmx.org/) templated in [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) and [Askama](https://github.com/askama-rs/askama), with server-side rendering (SSR) support in mind.

## STATUS: **Under Development 🚧 🏗️**

Crustwind is currently in development and is not yet ready for production use.
